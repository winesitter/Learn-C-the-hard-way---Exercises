# Winefind - A grep clone
---

Hello world! This is my personal clone of grep, which I wrote in my spare time. 
It is definitely not better than grep, so better do not use it.
However, it was fun to write it.

## Usage
`> winefind "your-query"`

It goes only through files, whose type is specified within ".winefind_logs", which must 
be located in your home directory.



Have fun!
